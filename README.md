# Today I...
Keeping track of what you do each day

## Motivation
I hate coming to the end of a day and asking myself what I did today only to answer it with "I
don't know" is unacceptable, yet that's often how days go for me. Like everything problem in life,
computers can fix it. 

## Install
```bash
curl <path> | bash
```
(look above to the `install.sh` script for transparency)

## Using
Any time you want to log an event, run the `todayi` command, passing a message:
```bash
todayi rode a horse
todayi figured out lisp
```

If you'd like to see your log, run `todayi` without any arguments.
